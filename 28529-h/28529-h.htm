<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The Editor with the most profound respect, submits to the Public the
following <span class="smcap">narrative</span>.&mdash;It forms a small portion
of a more extended work, calculated to contain the particulars of every remarkable
occurrence, connected with the Rebellion, which happened in the
course of the last year;&mdash;a year which will constitute an
<span class="smcap">epoch</span> in the history of Ireland, and the
events of which ought to be universally known.</p>

<p>The moment of action is not the most favourable to accuracy of
detail:&mdash;Notwithstanding the purest intentions and the most
scrupulous regard to truth, much will remain, for candour to
extenuate and information to supply. Impressed with this sentiment,
and feeling the importance of the subject, the Editor has waited

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>

till the season of tranquility, and now presents to the public eye,
the produce of his exertions. He wished to postpone the Publication
in order to complete it, but he yields to the entreaties of his
Friends, and finds it necessary to make some sacrifice to the
eagerness of public curiosity: The remaining part is in preparation
for the Press, and as he continues to be supplied by those who were
witnesses at the transactions, and consequently most capable of
communicating correct intelligence, he hopes soon to accomplish his
design.</p>

<p>The Reader will perceive from the following specimen, that the
accounts of the Battles are not arranged in chronological order;
neither do they boast of any great pretensions to literary merit;

<!-- Page v -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>
but they will be found to have a recommendation more valuable than
either&mdash;<span class="smcap">authenticity</span>. The Editor was less solicitous about the style
of the work, than the truth of it, and where, upon investigation,
the matter conveyed to him proved correct, he has given it in the
language of his correspondent.</p>

<p>If History be, as it has been elegantly described, "Philosophy
teaching by Example,"&mdash;what example more necessary to be held out to
public view, and transmitted to posterity, than that which shews the
dreadful effects of a Revolution attempted by force? Where the
visionary politician enjoys for so short a time his sanguinary
triumph&mdash;suspected even by those whom he calls his friends, he is
superseded by such as are more ferocious than himself, while the
fury of Fanaticism equally destroys <i>his</i> prospects in the mad
effort to exterminate

one religion and substitute another.</p>

<p>The perusal of such transactions must suggest useful reflections.
The surviving Loyalist will rejoice in the triumph of <i>law</i> and the
restoration of <i>order</i>. The surviving Rebel will repent of his
folly, and enjoy the comforts which Law and Order distribute.</p>

<p>Such are the motives and such the object which influence the Editor
of this little Work. From those who may approve of it, and whose
situation and leisure furnish the opportunity, he requests further
assistance. Particulars of Engagements, not included in this part,
will be thankfully received, and due attention paid to them in the
subsequent Publication.</p>

<p>CLONARD is situate about Twenty five miles from Dublin on the
Western road leading to Mullingar. Tho' constituted a post town, it
is a very small village, consisting of an Inn and a few thatched
houses; but from its situation being on the confines of two
counties, Kildare and Meath, and having a bridge across the river
Boyne, which opens a communication from Dublin

<!-- Page 4 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
to Westmeath, and
from thence to Athlone and the Province of Connaught, it must be
considered as a very important pass in all times of commotion and
war. On the Dublin side of the town is situated the mansion house of
the Tyrrell family, and at present belongs to <i>John Tyrrell</i>&nbsp;Esq. It
is an old fashioned house, fronting the road from which it is
separated by a high wall and a court yard; having an extensive
garden upon its right, and a sheet of water upon the left.&mdash;Mr.&nbsp;John
Tyrrell, being a Magistrate of both Counties, Kildare and Meath, and
having exerted himself early to suppress the disturbances which were
occasioned by the Defenders, naturally became an object of their
resentment, and having been repeatedly menaced with an attack, he
fortified his house by building up the original hall door, opening
another, which might flank the approach to the house, and
barricading all the lower windows, so as to render them musquet
proof.</p>

<p>Upon the institution of the Yeomenry, Mr.&nbsp;John Tyrrell was honoured
with a Commission to

<!-- Page 5 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
raise a Corps of Cavalry, which was
immediately embodied, under the Title of the <i>Clonard Cavalry</i>, and
Thomas Tyrrell, and Thomas Barlow, Esqs. were appointed Lieutenants.
This Corps soon distinguished itself by its unwearied exertions to
preserve the peace of the neighbourhood; but in the course of the
Spring of 1798, Mr.&nbsp;John Tyrrell the Captain, receiving positive
information of a conspiracy to take away his life, thought it
prudent to retire with his family into England.</p>

<p>The command of the Corps consequently devolved upon Mr.&nbsp;Thomas
Tyrrell, the first Lieutenant, who had also at this critical period
been appointed High Sheriff of the County of Kildare.&mdash;Upon the
tenth of May 1798, he received an official letter, ordering the
Clonard Cavalry upon permanent duty; in this emergency Mr.&nbsp;Thomas
Tyrrell, finding his own house at Kilreiny about one mile and a half
from Clonard inconvenient, and in truth indefensible from its
situation, removed with his family to his Kinsman's house at
Clonard, before described, where

<!-- Page 6 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
he mounted a guard of one Serjeant
and 18 men who were to be relieved every week.</p>

<p>Orders were about the same time issued to Captain O&nbsp;Ferrall of the
Ballina Cavalry, to mount a permanent guard at Johnstown, near the
Nineteen Mile house, which were accordingly complied with: but upon
the 16th of May, reports of a general rising having been circulated,
and being corroborated by encreasing outrages in the neighbourhood,
Captain O&nbsp;Ferrall was permitted to fall back from Johnstown to
Clonard in the night time for protection; repairing to Johnstown at
four o'Clock in the morning, and retiring to Clonard in the evening.</p>

<p>In this way matters went on for some time, when the country becoming
still more disturbed and apprehensions of an attack upon Clonard
becoming more serious, Lieutenant Thomas Tyrrell repaired to Dublin,
with an escort of his Corps, leaving the command at Clonard with
Lieutenant Barlow. The object of this visit to Dublin, was to
represent to Government the situation of that part of the country,
the daily apprehensions

<!-- Page 7 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
of an attack, and the necessity of a
reinforcement. Lord Castlereagh, to whom these representations were
made, answered, that under the existing circumstances no force could
be sent to Clonard, but Mr.&nbsp;Thomas Tyrrell was authorized to raise
some Supplementaries, for whom he would be supplied with arms and
ammunition.</p>

<p>Pending this application in Dublin, viz. upon the 29th of May the
Rebels assembled to the number of 800 in the village of Carbery,
five miles from Clonard, where they burned the Protestant Charter
School and several houses; they then proceeded through Johnstown,
burning and destroying the house of every protestant near the road.
Towards evening they halted at a place called Gurteen, where they
destroyed the house of Mr.&nbsp;Francis Metcalf.&mdash;When intelligence of
these transactions reached Clonard, Lieutenant Barlow marched out
with a party of the guard, and being joined by Captain O&nbsp;Ferrall
they went in pursuit of the Rebels, but did not over take them,
until they had halted at Gurteen, where

<!-- Page 8 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
they had taken a very
advantageous position upon each side of a narrow road, behind strong
quickset hedges, so that Cavalry could not approach them with any
prospect of success. Lieutenant Barlow halted his men, and then
advancing some paces towards the enemy, took off his helmet, and
challenged them to come forward. They however declined leaving their
entrenchments, and night approaching, the Yeomenry with great
reluctance returned to their Guard house.</p>

<p>On the 30th of May Lieutenant Thomas Tyrrell arrived safe from
Dublin, with his escort, carabines for the Troop, musquets for the
Supplementaries and a quantity of ammunition. The next day he
enrolled nineteen well affected protestants to act as
Supplementaries and dismounted.</p>

<p>By this time the Rebels had collected a very considerable force and
every night committed some outrage and depredation. They encamped
upon an Island in the bog of Timahoe, and also at Mucklin and
Dreihid; they plundered almost every

<!-- Page 9 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
house in the neighbourhood of
their respective places, drove away all the fat cattle and horse
they could meet, and intercepted the supplies for the Dublin market.</p>

<h2 class="narr"><i><a name="BATTLE_OF_TIMAHOE" id="BATTLE_OF_TIMAHOE"></a>BATTLE OF TIMAHOE.</i></h2>

<p>Government being apprized of these proceedings, dispatched General
Champagne to Clonard, where he arrived upon the 6th of June; and
after consulting with Lieutenant Tyrrell, was escorted by him to
Edendery, where the General expected a detatchment of the Limerick
Militia; but being disappointed in this respect, an express was sent
to Philipstown to hasten the reinforcement, which arrived at
Edendery upon the evening of the 7th; and on the next day, General
Champagne, having arranged his plan of operations, marched from
Edendery, with the following forces: A detatchment of the Limerick
Militia, under Lieutenant Colonel Gough; the Coolestown Yeomen
Cavalry, under Captain Wakely and Lieutenant Cartland; the Canal
Legion, under Lieutenant Adam Williams; the Clonard Cavalry,
Lieutenant T. Tyrrell; and the

<!-- Page 10 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Ballina Cavalry, Captain O&nbsp;Ferrall.
These several corps were distributed, so as that the Cavalry should
surround the bog of Timahoe, while the Infantry attacked the Camp
upon the Island: This judicious plan was completely executed,&mdash;the
contest was obstinate for some time, owing to the small number of
the Infantry, who led on the attack; but their firmness and
discipline supplying the want of numbers, the Limerick, headed by
the gallant Colonel Gough, and ably supported by Lieutenant Williams
marched into the entrenchments, drove the Rebels from their camp,
who were attacked in their flight by the Cavalry and many of them
put to death. The Camp was entirely destroyed; and a great quantity
of prisoners and considerable booty were carried off by the victors!</p>

<p>On the 29th of June, Lieutenant Tyrrell having received information
that a large body of Rebels had stationed themselves upon a hill
near his dwelling-house at Kilreiny, and had committed various
robberies in the course of the preceding night,

<!-- Page 11 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
he went to Kinnegad
to solicit a reinforcement and sent an express to Edendery for a
force to co-operate with him. The Kinnegad Yeomen Cavalry, under
Lieutenant Houghton, and a small party of the Northumberland
Fencibles immediately marched with Lieutenant Tyrrell to Clonard,
and from thence being joined by his own Corps, he proceeded to
<i>Fox's hill</i>, where the Rebels were posted to the amount of
600.&mdash;The attack was began by the Clonard Supplementaries, who
displayed great steadiness upon this occasion; the Kinnegad Corps
and the Northumberlands supported the attack with great zeal, and
the Edenderry force consisting of a detatchment of the Limerick,
Lieutenant Colonel Gough, the Coolestown Cavalry, Captain Wakely and
the Canal Legion, Lieutenant Williams, having fallen upon the Rebels
from the opposite side, they were routed with considerable
slaughter. Their commander, one <i>Casey</i>, his brother and another
Leader were killed in this action, and their bodies brought to
Edenderry, where they were exposed for several days.</p>

<h2 class="narr"><a name="JUNCTION_OF_THE_WEXFORD" id="JUNCTION_OF_THE_WEXFORD"></a><i>JUNCTION OF THE WEXFORD AND KILDARE REBELS.</i></h2>

<p>It might have been hoped, that these successes would have
established tranquility in this neighbourhood, and probably such
effects would have followed the military exertions, were it not for
the irruption of a large column of Wexford Rebels into Kildare,
under the command of Colonel <i>Perry</i> who being immediately joined by
Colonel <i>Aylmer</i>, commanding the Rebel Camp at Prosperous, was
prevailed upon to abandon his intention of penetrating into the
North, and to adopt a plan suggested by <i>Aylmer</i>, of attacking
Clonard, pushing on from thence by Kilbeggan to the Shannon and
surprising Athlone. In pursuance of this plan, the Rebel Forces
amounting to 4000 men made a movement towards Clonard.</p>

<h2 class="narr"><i><a name="BATTLE_OF_CLONARD" id="BATTLE_OF_CLONARD"></a>BATTLE OF CLONARD.</i></h2>

<p>Lieutenant Tyrrell was totally unapprised of the intention, or
motions of the enemy:&mdash;his guard were extremely vigilant during each
night, but not apprehending any danger in the day

<!-- Page 13 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
time they frequently dispersed through the village for the purpose of
recreation and refreshment. This happened to be the case with many
of his men upon Wednesday morning the 11th of July, on which day,
about eleven o'Clock Mr.&nbsp;<i>Richard Allen</i> galloped into the Court,
and brought intelligence that he was pursued by a piquet guard of
the Rebels, whom he narrowly escaped as they were well mounted; and
he was confident a considerable force was approaching. The alarm was
instantly given&mdash;every exertion was made to collect the scattered
men, and parties were stationed in the most advantageous positions.
As the enemy were expected from the Dublin side, six of the Corps
(including Mr.&nbsp;Allen and Thomas Tyrrell junr. the Lieutenant's son,
and only fifteen years of age) took possession of an old Turret at
the extremity of the garden; and which commanded the road. Such was
the rapidity with which the Rebels advanced, that the firing
actually commenced from this quarter upon their Cavalry before the
entire guard could be collected, and the gate leading into the
Court yard

<!-- Page 14 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
was under such necessity closed to the exclusion of
several, so that when Lieutenant Tyrrell came to ascertain his
strength, he found he had only <i>Twenty-seven</i> men, including his own
three sons, the eldest of whom was only seventeen years old! Such a
critical situation required the coolness of a man innured to
military danger, and all the exertion, firmness and skill of a
veteran soldier. But although Lieutenant Tyrrell never had served in
the Army, his own good sense supplied the want of experience, and
his native courage furnished resources adequate to the magnitude of
the occasion. He found his men as zealous as himself, determined to
maintain their post and to discharge their duty to their King and
Country, or fall in such a glorious cause. After sending a supply of
ammunition to the advanced post at the Turret, and stationing other
out-posts, he retired into the house with the main body, from which
he selected the best marksmen, and placing them at particular
windows gave directions that they should not fire without having
their object covered, he had the rest of the

<!-- Page 15 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
men secured behind the
walls and incessantly employed in loading musquets and carabines for
the marksmen at the windows.</p>

<p>The firing as we have observed commenced from the Turret at the
extremity of the garden. About 300 of the Rebel Cavalry lead on by
one <i>Farrell</i> formed their advanced guard, and approached the Turret
in a smart trot, without appearing to apprehend any danger. The
first shot was fired by young Mr.&nbsp;Tyrrell, which mortally wounded
Farrell, and being followed by a general discharge from the rest
among the body of the Cavalry, threw them into great confusion, in
which state they fled out of the reach of the firing. The Infantry
however coming up, many of them contrived to pass the Turret under
cover of the wall, and numbers were posted behind a thick hedge on
the opposite side of the road, from which they kept up a smart fire
against the Turret, but without doing any material mischief.</p>

<p>The Infantry who had passed the Turret being joined by a party who
came by a cross road (for it seems their plan was to surround the
house by

<!-- Page 16 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
advancing in different directions) they stationed a guard
upon the Bridge to prevent any reinforcement arriving in that
direction. About ten or a dozen of this guard were in a very few
minutes shot by the marksmen from the windows, upon which the rest
fled; not one of the Rebels ventured afterwards to appear upon the
Bridge, so that the communication with the Western road was in a
great measure preserved, the importance of which to the little
garrison in Clonard will appear in the event of the day.</p>

<p>The enemy being thus defeated in their first onset in both points of
attack, became exasperated to an extravagant pitch of fury, and
determined upon the most savage revenge. A large party contrived to
penetrate into the garden, by the rere, and some of them immediately
rushed into the Turret. The Yeomen stationed there were upon an
upper floor&mdash;they had the precaution to drag up the ladder by which
they ascended;&mdash;the Rebels endeavoured to climb upon each other, so
as to reach the upper story, but they were killed as fast as they
appeared; others

<!-- Page 17 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
then ran their pikes through the cieling, and
fired shots but without effect&mdash;the conflict was obstinate&mdash;twenty
seven of the Rebels lay dead on the ground floor, when at length, a
quantity of straw was brought and set on fire. The building was soon
in flames; two of the yeomen, Mr.&nbsp;Michael Cusack and Mr.&nbsp;George
Tyrrell, endeavouring to force their way through the smoke were
immediately put to death; the rest of the party viz. Mr.&nbsp;Allen,
young Mr.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Tyrrell, and two others escaped by leaping from a
window twenty foot high into an hay-yard, from whence under cover of
a wall which divided it from the garden they escaped into the house.</p>

<p>Having succeeded so well by the effect of conflagration, the enemy
set fire to the Toll house and some other cabbins on the left near
the Bridge, for the purpose of embarassing and confusing the
garrison; during this operation, they were seen throwing their dead
into the flames, for the purpose, it was thought of evading
discovery.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 18 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
</div>

<p>The Battle had now lasted near six hours: about five in the evening
the approach of succour was descried from the house&mdash;the hopes of
all were elevated and they fought with renovated vigour.</p>

<p>One of the guard who had been excluded by the sudden shutting of the
gates in the morning, finding he could be of no other use, repaired
to Kinnegad, represented the situation of his friends at Clonard,
upon which fourteen of the Kinnegad Infantry, under Lieutenant
Houghton, and eleven Northumberland Fencibles, under the command of
a Serjeant, immediately collected and with great gallantry marched
for Clonard. The communication by the Bridge having been kept open
in the manner before related, Lieutenant Tyrrell sallied from the
house, and soon effected a junction with this reinforcement. A few
vollies completely cleared the roads, and having then placed the
Northumberland and Kinnegad men in such situations as most
effectually to gall the enemy in their retreat from the garden, the
Lieutenant

<!-- Page 19 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
undertook in person, the hazardous enterprise of
dislodging them from thence.</p>

<p>At this time, it is supposed there were 400 Rebels in the garden;
numbers of them were posted upon a mount planted with old fir trees,
which afforded considerable protection, and many lay concealed
behind a privet hedge, from whence they could distinctly see every
person who entered the garden, tho' they could not be seen
themselves&mdash;Lieutenant Tyrrell at the head of a few picked men,
rushed into the garden; and was received by a general discharge from
both parties of the enemy: no time was lost in attacking the party
behind the hedge, who being defeated, retired to the mount;&mdash;here
the action again became warm, the Rebels appeared determined to
maintain the advantage of their situation, and the Yeomen, tho'
fatigued with the labour of the day, could not think of retiring.
Six of them were badly wounded, among whom was Mr.&nbsp;Richard Allen,
who had so gallantly defended the Turrett&mdash;a ball passed thro' his
left arm, and entered his side; his comrades still persevered with

<!-- Page 20 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the most undaunted courage, and supporting a steady and well
directed fire against the mount, the enemy were at length dispersed,
and in their flight were met by the Northumberland and Kinnegad
Corps who made great havoc among them.</p>

<p>The victory was now complete&mdash;as glorious an achievement, we will
venture to say, as occurred during the whole rebellion, and for
which the gallant officers and men can never be too much applauded,
whether we consider it as an unexampled display of genuine loyalty
and true courage, or estimate its value from its immence importance
to that part of the country and the kingdom at large. It was the
first check which the United Army of Wexford and Kildare experienced
and proved the fore-runner of those multiplied defeats which
terminated in its total dispersion.</p>

<h2 class="narr"><i><a name="MRS_TYRRELLS_SUFFERINGS" id="MRS_TYRRELLS_SUFFERINGS"></a>MRS. TYRRELL'S SUFFERINGS WHILE PRISONER WITH THE REBELS.</i></h2>

<p>After the Battle it might have been expected that the little
garrison would have given themselves

<!-- Page 21 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
up to an excess of joy; but
the breast of their Commander was filled with anxious
solicitude&mdash;&mdash;the partner of his heart&mdash;his wife, the mother of
those three gallant youths, who mixed in the hottest scenes of the
day, was absent the whole time, and no tidings of her had reached
the garrison. The men sympathised with the husband and the children,
and success was thought incomplete, until she was restored to their
embraces.</p>

<p>Probably the reader may participate somewhat of a similar feeling,
and desire some gratification from a brief narrative of the
circumstances attending the Lady while in possession of the Rebels.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th of July, about the hour that the guard
dispersed, as we have before mentioned, Mrs.&nbsp;Tyrrell went in her
carriage from Clonard to her own house at Kilreiny upon some
domestic concerns&mdash;she soon heard the Rebels were approaching, and
speedily drove back with the hope of reaching Clonard before them.

<!-- Page 22 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
In this however she was disappointed; the noise of musquetry
convinced her of the impractibility of this attempt. The servant was
ordered to turn about and drive to Kilreiny, from whence she
intended to send an express to Edenderry&mdash;she had not however
proceeded many yards, when the carriage was overtaken by two men on
horseback, armed with drawn swords who with oaths and menaces
ordered the servant to stop&mdash;They turned the carriage back towards
Clonard until they overtook about 200 men armed with pikes, a few
musquets and some swords. They searched the carriage for arms, but
did not find any. Mrs.&nbsp;Tyrrell describes the men as a ragged,
wretched looking banditti: three of them, armed with musquets
mounted the boot of the carriage; three more got behind it&mdash;and in
this manner attended by a great crowd, the carriage was drove two
miles round to the high road leading from Dublin to Clonard: here
they kept her a prisoner, notwithstanding her frequent entreaties to
be enlarged; she at one time apprehended the pike-men would cut her
to pieces, as they

<!-- Page 23 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
quarrelled among themselves, some disposed to
treat her with civility&mdash;others the reverse&mdash;After some time she
prevailed upon them to permit her to retire into a cabin, the
inhabitants of which knew her, and two men armed with musquets were
placed as centries. She there remained, until the Rebels were
defeated at Clonard, when the whole body upon their retreat
assembled at the cabin; one of the rebel officers came in and
desired Mrs.&nbsp;Tyrrell to get into her carriage; she asked for what
purpose. He replied, that she must go with them; she entreated him
to permit her to remain where she was, and that her carriage and
horses were at his service; he for some time denied her request: but
falling on her knees to supplicate him, he told her she might
stay:&mdash;He then withdrew, but immediately a great common fellow came
in, seized her by the arm, dragged her to the door, and desired some
men to lift her upon a horse, which had been provided for her, as
some wounded men were to be put into the carriage. Mrs.&nbsp;Tyrrell's
alarm now became excessive&mdash;she looked

<!-- Page 24 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
round for the person, who
had consented to let her remain in the cabin, and getting her arms
round him reminded him of his promise. He acknowledged his
engagement, but confessed he had not power to perform it&mdash;that she
must go with them, but would be accomodated with her own carriage.
Three or four men then thrust her into the carriage, which moved on,
attended by an immense body of people, and a great number of
officers. When they had proceeded about a mile, the carriage was
stopped and entered by Col.&nbsp;<i>Perry</i>, who said, he was fatigued.
Mrs.&nbsp;Tyrrell endeavoured to prevail upon him to let her go&mdash;but in
vain&mdash;she told him, she would use all her influence for his
advantage, if ever she had an oportunity&mdash;He answered, that the
Yeomen had taken a general officer, at Clonard, and that she must
remain a Prisoner till his fate was known.&mdash;After some time, the
carriage was stopped again, and a fellow came in, who told
Col.&nbsp;<i>Perry</i>, <i>he</i> had a right to it, as he had taken it, and tho' quite
a common fellow, <i>Perry</i> had not power to prevent

<!-- Page 25 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
him. Mrs.&nbsp;<i>Tyrrell</i> then applied to this <ins class="correction">man</ins> for
protection; he answered, that
she <ins class="correction">could</ins> not obtain her liberty. She was now reduced to all the
anguish of despair, when a gleam of hope suddenly darted across her
mind, upon <ins class="correction">seeing</ins> a man riding beside the carriage whose countenance
was perfectly familiar&mdash;This was one <i>Kearns</i>, a popish priest, who
had been for some <ins class="correction">time</ins> a curate in the neighbourhood of
Clonard, <ins class="correction">and</ins>

herself to despair, and began to prepare herself for that
death, which she now looked upon as inevitable.&mdash;&mdash;A man, who sat
upon the boot of the carriage, was suddenly struck with the fervency
of her devotion, and turning round, said, <i>He</i> had as much authority
as any other man there, and that the lady should do as she pleased.
Elevated a little from her despondency by this expression,
Mrs.&nbsp;Tyrrell gave him her gold watch, promising him any further reward he
would demand, if he would procure her liberty.&mdash;&mdash;At this time a
person in the garb of an officer, and whose countance beamed with
the rays of humanity, rode up to the carriage&mdash;she immedeiately
addressed him in the most supplicating terms&mdash;imploring him to take
pity upon a poor defenceless woman, who had not, and who could not
injure him&mdash;He interrogated her as to who she was and how she came
there.&mdash;She told him&mdash;He protested, that he did not before know of
any such thing and requested to know, what she wished to do&mdash;&mdash;She
replied that she only required to be let on her feet, that she
might proceed

home. He immediately ordered the cavalcade to
stop&mdash;handed her out of the carriage in the most kind and humane
manner&mdash;conducted her thro' an immense crowd of armed men, and
apologized for not accompanying her to Clonard, by saying, "she
knew, he could not do it with safety."&mdash;Mrs.&nbsp;Tyrrell made him the
acknowledgements of a grateful heart, and begged to be entrusted
with his name, that if ever it should be in her power, she might
return the kindness she had then experienced and repay the
obligations she had received.&mdash;He said, he was afraid, she could not
do him any service, and with apparent reluctance, told her, he was
Captain <i>Byrne</i>!&mdash;He then returned to his party, and Mrs.&nbsp;Tyrrell
having met some of the people in whose cabin she was a prisoner,
they accompanied her to Clonard, where she was consoled for all her
sufferings by finding her husband and children alive.</p>

<p>The gentleman (for such his conduct evinced him to be) who called
himself, Captain <i>Byrne</i>, proved to be Mr.&nbsp;<i>Byrne</i> of Ballymanus, in
the county of Wicklow, who afterwards surrendered himself

<!-- Page 28 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
to
Government, and Lieutenant Tyrrell being in Dublin at the time,
repaired to the Castle, had an interview with Mr.&nbsp;Byrne, expressed
his acknowledgements to him in the warmest terms, and represented
the conduct of Mr.&nbsp;Byrne to the administration in such a manner, as
shewed the Lieutenant's sense of the obligation, while it promoted
the lenient disposition which was afterwards manifested to Mr.&nbsp;Byrne.</p>

<p>Thus have we given an authentic detail of the battle of Clonard and
the circumstances attending it, which in fact have been but little
known, no official account having ever been published concerning it.
One subject of regret however remains for the victors in the loss of
Mr.&nbsp;<i>Richard Allen</i>, who died of his wounds in a few days after at
Mullingar, regretted by all who knew him, as a young gentleman of
unsullied integrity and undaunted courage&mdash;attached to his King by
the purest principles of loyalty, and to his family by the warmest
affection&mdash;He was a zealous yeoman and a steady friend. All that
seems necessary to add, is to say

a few words respecting the fate
of this Rebel Army and its leaders.</p>

<p>After proceeding some distance from Clonard, along the Dublin road,
they turned to the right and took up their quarters for the night in
the village of Carbery&mdash;where they possessed themselves of Lord
Harberton's house, and indulged in drinking wine and spirits to
excess&mdash;they were most of them intoxicated, in which state had they
been attacked, they must have been totally destroyed.&mdash;But the force
at Clonard was too small, had suffered too severely and expended too
much ammunition to attempt a pursuit&mdash;On the morning of the 12th of
July, the Rebels moved from Carbery to Johnstown, and from thence by
the nineteen-mile-house into the county of Meath&mdash;They were pursued
by Lieutenant Col.&nbsp;Gough, with a small party of the Limerick
Militia, and the Edenderry yeomen&mdash;An express had been sent to
Col.&nbsp;Gordon, commanding at Trim, to march out with a force from thence,
and co-operate with the Edenderry detachment&mdash;Col.&nbsp;Gordon

<!-- Page 30 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
accordingly left Trim with 200 men and two pieces of cannon, but
from some fatality, yet unexplained, did not join in the attack,
which Lieutenant Col.&nbsp;Gough, after waiting some time and
reconnoitering the enemy posted upon a hill, commenced against them,
with only sixty infantry and twenty cavalry. The event of that
engagement is well known, the Rebels were compleatly defeated,
leaving immense booty of cattle,&nbsp;&amp;c. behind them.</p>

<p>They were next pursued by General Myers, with detachments of the
Dublin Yeomenry and Buckinhamshire Militia, and tho' the General was
not fortunate enough to overtake them, yet he drove them towards
Slane, where they were attacked by General Meyrick, and in several
subsequent days were met by different military bodies who
successively routed them, so that at length this formidable body was
completely dispersed.</p>

<i>Clonbollogue</i>, where they were apprehended by Mr.&nbsp;Ridgeway and
Mr.&nbsp;Robinson of the Edenderry Yeomen, who brought them to that town,
where they were tried and executed by martial law. <i>Perry</i> was
extremely communicative, and while in custody both before and after
trial gratified the enquiries of every person who spoke to him, and
made such a favourable impression, that many regretted his fate&mdash;He
acknowledged, that 150 of the rebels were killed and 60 wounded at
Clonard&mdash;which tho' accomplished by 27 men will not appear
extraordinary, when it is known that these 27 men fired upwards of
1300 ball cartridge.</p>

sulky, and seldom spoke, save to upbraid <i>Perry</i> for his candid

Clonard, and having suffered so much by democratic rage and
insurrectionary fury, he was looked upon as an acquisition in the

against these nightly marawders with such appearance of sincerity
and zeal, that he was frequently consulted by the Magistrates, and
sometimes accompanied them in their patroles&mdash;Some suspicion of
treachery on his part was at length entertained, from the uniform
discovery of the operations agreed upon by the Magistrates, in
consequence of which, he was excluded from their councils, and a
positive information being sworn against him for instigating a
murder which was afterwards actually committed, he fled into
Wexford, where he became a member of an assassinating committee,

is known to have encouraged, and which finally led him to that fate,

filled with gloomy and ferocious passions&mdash;He seemed rather to be an
instrument of Hell, than a minister of Heaven, for his mind was
perpetually brooding over sanguinary schemes and plans of rapine,

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Carlow</span> <span class="smcap">June</span> 31st, 1798.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>My Dr. Friend,</i></p>

<p>YOUR affectionate letter I did not receive till eight days after
date: I have felt much uneasiness at not having it in my power to
answer it sooner; you may think it strange that in the space of ten
days I could not procure time for that purpose, but were you
acquainted with my situation you would be convinced that it is a
fact. If I live to see you, I trust fully to convince you of the
same.</p>

<p>Providentially for me I was absent from Carlow the time of the
attack on that Town, I say providentially, for my warm spirit and
forward disposition might have led me into danger. The account which
I received from people of veracity, who were on the spot is as
follows.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 35 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
</div>

<p>On the 24th of May, the day preceding the attack, Haydon, a Yeoman,
but an officer of the Rebels, repaired to the Country, and spent the
day in mustering his Forces. A letter relative to the business,
directed to Mr.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;D. of Arles, was by mistake put into the hands of
a Loyal Yeoman of the same christian and sirname, and residing in
the same place: The bearer was conveyed to Maryborough and executed,
and the letter sent to Col.&nbsp;M&mdash; who commanded in Carlow, by means of
which the Military had timely notice of the intentions of the
Rebels. There being no Barrack for Infantry in the Town, the men
were billeted upon the Inhabitants; the genteeler sort paying for
their lodging, they were in general quartered in the Cabins. The
intention of the Rebels was to murder the Soldiers in their
lodgings, surprise and take the Horse Barracks, and then make
themselves masters of the Town, which in all probability they would
have done, had not God brought their designs to light in the manner
above mentioned; for on receipt of the above information the
Infantry were ordered into

<!-- Page 36 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the Barracks, and kept under arms till
the Insurgents had entered the Town.</p>

<p>About twelve o'Clock the Rebels came forward in great force, and too
confident of a victory not yet gained, gave three cheers crying "the
Town is our own!" but how dreadfully were they disappointed? for in
that moment, the military rushing forward, cut them down in all
quarters; and having posted themselves in an advantageous manner cut
off almost all possibility of a retreat. Many of these deluded
creatures fled into the houses for shelter, but there justice
pursued them&mdash;for the Soldiers set them on fire immediately. About
eighty houses were burned, but the numbers consumed therein could
not be ascertained.</p>

<p>It is supposed not less than six hundred fell that morning; and what
is surprising, only two I believe were found among the bodies with
any simptoms of life!</p>

<p>Thus did God frustrate the designs of the wicked, and display his
justice and mercy in a singular manner&mdash;His justice, in suffering
the ungodly

<!-- Page 37 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
to fall into the pit which they had digged for their
innocent, unoffending neighbours; and his mercy, in preserving those
whom he employed as the Executioners of his vengeance on his
Enemies. Not a Soldier or Yeoman was so much as slightly wounded!
One Soldier indeed who had not left his billet, they hung with a
sheet; but being soon extricated he recovered immediately.</p>

<p>Sir.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Bart. Haydon, Kelly, Kane, Borro, two Murphys, one of
them a Serjeant in the Yeomenry, and several others were executed a
few days after. Haydon it is said, finding it going against his
friends, slipt into his Father's house, dressed himself in his
Regimentals, and came out and fought against those whom he had a few
hours before led to the slaughter.</p>

<p>Thus by the interference of <span class="smcap">him</span> who declares a hair of our head
cannot fall without his permission, was an innocent people saved
from the murderous designs of a Sanguinary Foe.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_II" id="LETTER_II"></a>LETTER II.</h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Ross</span>, <span class="smcap">July</span> 20th, 1798.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>My Dr. Friend,</i></p>

<p>The following account relative to the affair at Ross is remarkably
brief: particulars would fill a Volume, and as there are many things
said concerning it which cannot be depended on, I think it best to
confine myself to a few plain facts which are not disputed by any.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June in the evening, the Rebels to the amount of near
20000, took possession of Corbit Hill, one mile distant from Ross.
The military force in the town was remarkably small, the fears of
the Inhabitants were raised to an alarming height, but the coming in
of the County Dublin Militia quieted them much.</p>

<p>Between three and four o'Clock on the morning of the fifth, the
engagement commenced, Early in the action the Rebels were for some
time victorious, having driven before them all the black cattle they
could collect through the country; this threw the military into
confusion, and obliged

<!-- Page 39 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
many of them to retreat in great confusion
over the Bridge; some pieces of Cannon also fell into the hands of
the Enemy. The Rebels then set fire to the houses in the suburbs,
about two hundred and fifty of which were consumed; but this turned
to their own disadvantage, for the wind blowing towards them they
were inveloped in smoke, which together with the immoderate quantity
of spirituous liquors they drank on Corbet-Hill, rendered them
incapable of their business. The Dublin and Donegal Militia who kept
the guards at the Market-house and Fair-gate never left their post,
by means of which the Rebels could not penetrate into the centre of
the town; had they ran, Ross, and in all probability the provincial
towns in Munster would have fallen.</p>

<p>The Soldiers who retreated (except some who fled to Waterford) soon
rallied again, and entering the town in a furious manner, obliged
the enemy to run. The Battle lasted for near twelve hours&mdash;3000
Rebels it is said lay dead in and near the town; many also must have
died of their wounds:

<!-- Page 40 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
'tis thought that between fifty and sixty of
the Military fell: 'twas too many, but we could hardly expect such a
victory on more reasonable terms. B.&nbsp;B. Harvey was commander in
chief of the Rebels; but for his bad generalship on that day was
deposed, and the command was afterwards given to Roach.</p>

<p>'Twas on this dreadful day that the Barn at Scollabogue, in which
one hundred and seventy Protestants, Men, Women, and Children were
confined, was burned: the Rebels in their retreat from Ross set it
on fire, lest the Prisoners would escape. About twenty of these
sufferers I was personally acquainted with, some of them were my
intimate friends. This burning was not the act of one person as some
report, Priest Shallow of the parish of Newbawn was present, and
twenty five not included in the above number were shot in the most
deliberate manner, their cloaths being worth preserving. I pass
within two miles of the melancholy spot every month, and often
converse with those who know every particular relative to it, both
Loyalists and Rebels.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_III" id="LETTER_III"></a>LETTER III.</h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Colliery</span>, <span class="smcap">August</span> 1st, 1798.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>My Dr. Friend,</i></p>

<p>It would give me much satisfaction to have it in my power fully to
comply with your request, by furnishing you with an accurate detail
of the Engagements which took place between his Majesty's Troops and
the Rebels, for the publication you mention. If the following
particulars to which I was an eye witness can be of any service, you
are at liberty to make what use you please of the same.</p>

<p>On the Morning of the twenty third of June, the Rebels who had been
driven from Vinegar Hill appeared opposite New-Bridge or
Gore's-Bridge, a neat Village on the River Barrow, Co.&nbsp;Kilkenny. The
Forces quartered there, consisting of one Troop of the 4th Dragoon
Guards and a Company of the Wexford Militia prepared to stop their
progress, and in order thereto took possession of the Bridge; but
perceiving the Rebels planting their Cannon on the opposite side,
and fording the River in considerable numbers

<!-- Page 42 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
(the water being
low,) they were obliged to retreat; all the Cavalry escaped, but
about twenty of the Infantry were made Prisoners, many of whom were
put to death on that and the following day. Their intention (as one
who had been prisoner with them informed me) was to form a junction
with the Colliers, and after taking Castle Comber, to proceed to
Kilkenny on Monday morning.</p>

<p>From New-Bridge they proceeded through Kelly-Mount (plundering as
they went along) to a hill five miles from Castle-Comber, in the
range of mountains called the Ridge, where they stopped for the
night.</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to get to Ross according to my travelling
plan, I was obliged to take up my quarters in the Colliery the week
before. Here I remained in total ignorance of what was going forward
in other parts of the Country, till the twenty third, the day above
mentioned, when an Express arrived, informing us that the Rebels had
crossed the Barrow, and were on their

<!-- Page 43 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
way here. In order to know
the truth of the information I rode off accompanied by a friend
towards the Ridge. After riding about three miles I got in view of
their Camp, and by the assistance of a pocket Tellescope could
discern their numbers to be about 8000. They had two stand of white
Colours, and some Soldiers (I suppose those taken that morning)
along with them. Here I met ten or twelve Loyalists with fire arms;
two or three of their company were just murdered by the Rebel
picquets, and some more wounded. Having procured a musket I advanced
with four more till we came in sight of the dead bodies; but as the
Rebel scouts were within musket shot we did not think it prudent to
venture farther.</p>

<p>Seeing a Man covered with blood a distance from me, I called to him;
he crawled forward and fell at my feet,&mdash;he was a Loyalist, and had
received a dreadful wound from a broad sword on the head, and a few
slight wounds on other parts of the body. Imagining there was no
probability of his recovery, I advised him to make

<!-- Page 44 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the best use of
the few remaining moments he had, but on examining his wounds, and
having cause to believe they were not mortal, I bound them up in the
best manner I could, and procuring a horse to carry him, my friend
and I at the risk of our lives brought him four miles across the
mountains to Castle-Comber, were he was dressed: He is now perfectly
recovered; and the happiness which the remembrance of that
transaction affords me, more than compensates for the danger and
labour which attended it.</p>

<p>From seven till ten o'Clock the roads were crowded with the
Protestants flying from all parts of the adjacent country, into
Castle-Comber. At one o'Clock a Troop of the 4th Dragoons, a Company
of the Downshire Militia, and a few Yeomen arrived from Ballinakill;
these with a Troop of the R.&nbsp;Irish Dragoons, two Companies of the
Waterford Militia, and one Corps of Yeomen Cavalry, about two
hundred and fifty in all, made up the whole of our Military force; a
small number to oppose 8000 Furies! but that the Battle is not to
the strong, the event of that day proved.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 45 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
</div>

<p>About four o'Clock, the Rebels arrived at Gurteen, three miles from
Castle Comber, where they heard Mass; at five they had Mass again,
(it being a holyday) at the Gizebo, a mile nearer.</p>

<p>Between six and seven the engagement began at Cool-bawn, one mile
and half from Town. Being with the advanced Guard I was present at
the commencement. The Rebels advanced in the most daring manner, and
in pretty good order, having placed their Musketeers in the front
who kept up a brisk fire. I continued behind the Infantry for about
fifteen minutes, during which time the balls were whistling on every
side. I was so ignorant as to enquire what occasioned the whistling
noise, and being informed it proceeded from the balls, I began to
think of providing for my safety, as my presence there was useless,
having at this time no Arms. I then planted myself behind the pier
of a gate; but observing the Rebels advance and the Soldiers to give
way, I rode back to the Town: the Cavalry followed immediately, and
just behind me shot a villain who

<!-- Page 46 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
had the audacity to desire the
Officer to surrender the Town. Here I had a miraculous escape; for
many of the Infantry who came down close behind me were shot, by
lurking Rebels from behind the hedges.</p>

<p>The Military then took possession of the Bridge, where the battle
continued hot for the space of fifteen minutes, when Captain G&mdash;n.
ordered a retreat: the Cavalry and part of the Infantry instantly
obeyed, but about twenty of the Waterford Militia absolutely
refused, declaring "they would prefer death to dishonour." they were
mostly Roman Catholics! I had not heard the order, but my horse
taking head ran off; when I knew their intentions, I did not attempt
to prevent him. We halted about a mile and half from the Town, when
looking behind we beheld it all in a blaze, the Rebel Inhabitants
and some who came the back way, set it on fire. The firing ceased
for a few minutes, the cause I know not, but words cannot express
what I felt that moment; I concluded that my unoffending friends had
fallen victims to the human

<!-- Page 47 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Savages: they were presented to my
imagination in a thousand dreadful forms. God pardon my feelings in
that moment! how hard it is to forgive such Enemies. I proceeded
slowly till I met General Asgill, with about 1000 Men: with these I
returned, sunk with sorrow, fearing the tragic sight which I
expected to present itself on entering the Town would be too much to
bear; but thanks be to God my fears were groundless,&mdash;the few
Military which remained, and about thirty Protestants, who were
determined to fight for their Wives and Children, or perish with
them, kept possession, nor suffered a Rebel to cross the Bridge. Our
Cannon in mistake played on the Town for some time, but
providentially no lives were lost thereby. The Rebels on sight of
the reinforcement took shelter in the woods, and from thence killed
a few of the Military; but eighteen rounds of Grape shot dislodged
them. 'Twas four in the afternoon before they retreated. It is said
400 of the Rebels fell. There were twenty six Protestants in
coloured cloaths, and about twenty Soldiers killed,

<!-- Page 48 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
some of the former were butchered in cold blood, in a manner too dreadful
to relate.</p>

<p>For the safety of Kilkenny, the Troops were obliged to return there
that night; the Loyalists who fled with them I think could not be
less than 600; they left the most of their property behind them,
which a party of the Rebels who returned carried off.</p>

<p>The hand of God was visible in our deliverance that day; but
remarkably so in three instances which I shall mention.&mdash;First, from
midnight till five o'Clock, we had the greatest Fog I remember to
have seen; had it not been for this, in all probability the Rebels
would have divided themselves into different parties, and surrounded
the Town: but being strangers in the Country, and not knowing where
they might meet the Army, they kept in a body on the main road, and
attacked us but in one place. Secondly, the burning of the Town; for
the day being remarkably calm, the smoak lay on the street, which
prevented them from seeing our Force; for had they known that the
Army fled, 'tis

<!-- Page 49 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
more than probable they would have entered, as
there were many Entrances unguarded.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Waterford Militia's disobedience of Orders,&mdash;had they
retreated without a very extraordinary miracle the Loyalists would
have fallen a prey to their unmerciful yet unprovoked Enemies.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>My Dr. Friend,</i></p>

<p>In a former letter you have an account of the fate of Castle-Comber,
&amp;c.&mdash;I have only to notice in this, that some Gentlemen who fell
into the hands of the Rebels while in possession of that town were
brought into the presence of the Rebel general Murphy, who is said
to have been a Priest in the Co.&nbsp;Wexford, and was excommunicated for
his bad conduct many years ago.&mdash;He was dressed in black, affected
the appearance of a stupid enthusiast, and shewed some bullets which
he said had been fired at him, but had rebounded from his
invulnerable body&mdash;incredible as it may seem, this wretched
invention was generally

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
believed by the more wretched dupes under
his command&mdash;You have here a real statement of the facts, of which I
know you have sufficient curiosity to desire to be informed.</p>

<p>On Monday morning<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> our reconnoitring parties observed the Rebel
Army posted on the bog, between John's-well mountains and the Ridge,
about eight miles distant from this City&mdash;they seemed to be at rest,
and remained quiet except when relieving their Centinels, till four
o'Clock, when they were observed to move to the right along the
Ridge towards Kelly-mount and New-bridge.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening several false alarms electrified the
inhabitants here&mdash;Yet the Garrison was left the whole day at rest.
Next morning Sir&nbsp;C. Asgill marched with a large force, consisting of
two pieces of Artillery, part of the Wexford and Wicklow regiments,
of the 4th, 5th, and 9th, Dragoons, of Hompesch's Cavalry, the
Romney Fencibles, and of the Kilkenny, Gowran, Fassadineen
Shillelogher, Desart, Thomastown, Myshall, and Kellishin Cavalry,
he

was joined on the march by the Leighlin-bridge Infantry, and part
of the Downshire Militia, with their Artillery, also the Maryborough
and Ballyfin Corps of Yeomen Cavalry.</p>

<p>About six o'Clock he came up with the Rebel Army, amounting to from
five to six thousand men, advantageously posted on a rising ground,
in an extensive flat, at Kilcomny, near Gore's-Bridge&mdash;nothing could
exceed the joy of our brave Soldiers, after so many fatiguing
marches, at last to have a pleasing prospect of retaliating; the
Officers were constantly obliged to restrain their ardour. The
engagement began with a terrible fire of Artillery, which the Rebels
returned with quickness, but entirely without effect.</p>

<p>A very hot fire was kept up near an hour, but unable to withstand
the impetuosity of our troops the Rebels began to give way, and fled
towards the Co.&nbsp;Wexford.</p>

<p>A horrible slaughter now ensued, which lasted six or seven hours,
nor did it cease while a Rebel was to be seen&mdash;1100 Rebels were left
dead on the field of Action! among whom was the <i>invulnerable

commander Murphy</i>. This victory was so very decisive that we have
got possession of all their Artillery, amounting to 15 pieces of
different callibre&mdash;all their Standards, Ammunition, and Baggage, a
vast number of Pikes, Muskets, Swords,&nbsp;&amp;c. 700 horses, a great
quantity of black cattle, Sheep,&nbsp;&amp;c. also a vast quantity of
bedding, blanketting, and wearing apparel which were given up to the
Soldiers who bravely contended for the same.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>My Dr. Friend,</i></p>

<p>Being desirous of making public the valour of the Troops of this
town under the command of Major Matthews of the Royal Downshire
Regiment, against the Rebels, I send you a plain narrative of facts
as follows:</p>

<p>On the 24th of June 1798, four hundred of the Downshire Regiment,
with their Battalion guns, Captain Pole, with the Ballyfin Troop of
Yeomen Cavalry, and Captain Gore, with the Maryborough,

<!-- Page 53 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
(both
Troops under the immediate command of Capt.&nbsp;Pole) proceeded towards
the Collieries of Castlecomber and Donane, by order of Sir&nbsp;Charles
Asgill. On the Road we saw Castlecomber on fire; soon after we
arrived at Moyad, and saw the Rebel Army in great force on the high
grounds above Donane; we then received intelligence that Sir&nbsp;Charles
had engaged them at Castlecomber that morning, and that his force
was at least double ours, but that he had retired to Kilkenny. It
was now too late in the evening for us to attack; we therefore fell
back on Timahoe, determined to be at them in the morning. At Timahoe
an express met us from Sir&nbsp;Charles, desiring we should return to
Maryborough; this was answered by an express from us, proposing to
Sir&nbsp;Charles to attack the Rebels next morning on the road from
Donane, and that we would attack on the road from Timahoe. The
answer to this proposal we received at 7&nbsp;o'clock next morning from
Sir&nbsp;Charles, who could not agree to it, as he said his Troops were
fatigued, but left it to us to fight, we

<!-- Page 54 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
could do it with security,
where we were, or to return to Maryborough. We chose to risque the
former, and the proper arrangements being made, returned to Moyad,
where we had last seen the Rebels: when our Cavalry arrived there,
they found the Rebels had gone off to the Ridge; there we pursued
them, and were again disappointed in bringing them to action, as
they had marched for Gore's-Bridge: our Cavalry then proceeded to
Old Leighlin, from which place Capt.&nbsp;Pole, who had gone forward for
intelligence, sent an express to inform Sir&nbsp;Charles Asgill of what
he had done, and of our intention to attack the Rebels wherever we
found them. At Old Leighlin we met with Mr.&nbsp;Vigars, to whom our
intention of attacking the Rebels was made known, and he, seeing our
men much fatigued, immediately supplied us with a number of cars to
carry them, without which assistance we should have been much
distressed; he likewise accompanied us to the scene of action, and
was always in front giving us every assistance in his power. The
whole Corps arrived at Leighlin-Bridge

<!-- Page 55 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
about twelve at night. In
two hours after an express came from Sir&nbsp;Charles, desiring us to
meet him at Gore's-Bridge at five in the morning; we instantly
marched, but on the road we got such intelligence as induced our
Commanding Officer to alter his route, in order to get between the
Rebels and the mountains; an account of which he sent to
Sir&nbsp;Charles, by Mr.&nbsp;Moore, Collector of this place, who, with his
brother Mr.&nbsp;Pierce Moore, marched with us, and to whose able advice
and knowledge of the country I heard Major Matthews say, we in a
great measure owed our success. After a march of about three hours
we came in sight of the Rebels; and, as soon as we got within a
proper distance, fired some cannon shot at them: they retired from
us about a mile and a half to form their line; we followed in
Column, with our guns in front, and our Cavalry in the rere; just as
we got orders to form our line for the attack, we heard
Sir&nbsp;Charles's cannon on the other side of the hill; at this instant our
Cavalry were ordered to charge, which they did in a most gallant

<!-- Page 56 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
stile; the Rebel line was instantly broke, and we joined
Sir&nbsp;Charles's Troops in the pursuit, which continued with great
slaughter for above six miles; all the cannon, horses, stores and
prisoners they had were taken, and their Army dispersed.</p>

<p>When it is known that the Rebel Army would not have been brought to
action, or even an attempt made upon them, but for the exertion of
this little Corps&mdash;and when it is known that this Corps pursued a
large body of Rebels at least five thousand strong, with ten pieces
of cannon, for nearly forty miles, without orders or directions from
any general Officer whatsoever, and that, except some bread they got
at Leighlin-Bridge, not a man of them tasted food for forty-four
hours, I think you will agree with me that they did their duty, and
that their country ought to know it.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_VI" id="LETTER_VI"></a>LETTER VI.</h2>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Belfast</span>, <span class="smcap">April</span> 29th, 1799.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>Sir,</i></p>

<p>In compliance to your request I shall set down briefly what has been
already communicated to a few, but must thro' the medium of your
intended publication be more generally circulated.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning June the 9th, 1798. Col.&nbsp;Stapleton having
received intimation of a number of people assembled at Saint-field,
and neighbourhood, he set out from Newtownards, with a detachment of
the York Fencible regiment, accompanied by the Newtownards and
Comber Yeomen Cavalry and Infantry; all-together about 320 men, and
two Field Pieces.</p>

<p>About half past four o'clock in the evening, this little Army fell
in with a body of Rebels, supposed to be between six and seven
thousand men, near Saintfield.</p>

<p>The Light Infantry, commanded by Captain Chetwynd advanced with
great gallantry to secure an eminence on the right, which having
accomplished,

<!-- Page 58 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
he was attacked by a force of at least three thousand
Rebels&mdash;the front armed with pikes, the centre and rear with
muskets, whose fire galled them severely till the body of the Troops
and Field Pieces came up, when the Rebels were routed with huge
slaughter. The Rebels by their own account lost above five hundred
men, among whom were many of their leaders. The King's Troops after
routing the Insurgents marched to Comber, where they halted during
the night&mdash;next morning proceeded to this Town.</p>

<p>I am much concerned to inform you of the loss of three brave
Officers by those miscreants hands in this action&mdash;<i>Capt.&nbsp;Chetwynd</i>,
<i>Lieut. Unite</i>, and <i>Ensign J. Sparks</i>: Lieut. Edenson was wounded.
The whole return of his Majesty's Troops were&mdash;29 Killed, and 22
wounded. Not only the valour of the other Officers that fell in this
engagement deserves to be publickly recorded, but that of the
amiable, gallant and much beloved Capt.&nbsp;C. ought not to be passed
without particular notice&mdash;This brave fellow at the head of

<!-- Page 59 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
his men received no less than nine pike wounds! notwithstanding which he
continued his position, encouraging by his example his men to fight
like loyal Soldiers; till alas, two wounds from muskets deprived
this hero of his existence, and our country of his future services.</p>

<p>Poor Sparks&mdash;whose race of glory was now ended, was but sixteen
years old, and had just before he fell, received for his intrepid
conduct the public approbation of his commanding Officer.</p>

<p>Too much praise cannot be given the Newtownards and Comber Yeomen
Cavalry, who, conducted by Captains Houghton and Cleland, evidenced
the greatest intrepidity during the whole of the action.</p>

<p>If it be possible to convince those deluded creatures who were then
in arms against the peace and prosperity of this Nation, and of
their certain destruction, should they again have recourse to such
rebellious measures, it must be the event of the above action, where
so many were cut off by such an inferior force.</p>

<p>P. S. It was ludicrous to behold the varied badges of distinction as
worn by the Rebel chiefs; some were dressed in green jackets, turned
up with white, others yellow, white vests, buckskin breeches,
half-boots, hats with white cock-neck feathers and green cockades,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Tyrell'spass</span>, <span class="smcap">April</span> 30th, 1799.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>Dr. Friend,</i></p>

<p>I should have answered your favour sooner, but was making every
possible enquiry in order to furnish you with the best account of
the engagement at Kilbeggan. The gentleman, the bearer of this (one
of our Officers) and I were present on the occasion.</p>

<p>On the 17th of June 1798, (on the preceding day a fair was held in
Kilbeggan. The lower order of the people appeared uncommonly civil,
and this country had a more placid appearance than for some time
before,) at 11&nbsp;o'clock at night a recruit of Capt.&nbsp;Clarke's gave
information that the town would

<!-- Page 61 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
be attacked on the next day. As
many similar alarms had been circulated before, this was not much
regarded&mdash;however the Videts of Horse were ordered to keep a sharp
look-out, and give instant intelligence should any number of men be
descried by them.</p>

<p>At break of day, (at that time of the year about two o'clock) some
persons were perceived on the top of a hill westward of the town.
Immediate notice of this was given to the Officer commanding, who
directed that the horse-guard should continue to observe the motions
of the enemy; and should their numbers encrease, to retreat slowly,
about two hundred yards in front to the town, and apprize him of the
same.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that their force was between three and four
thousand divided into bands, from sixty to an hundred, in regular
order, with different kinds of Arms, principally pikes, from five to
ten feet long, pitch-forks,&nbsp;&amp;c. Each band moved separately headed by
an Officer, distinguished by a green sash or cockade&mdash;most of the
men had white paper bands round their hats.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 62 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
</div>

<p>It was generally remarked that they had all clean shirts on, had
each a piece of oat-bread in their pockets, and many were apparently
intoxicated.</p>

<p>The town (the subject of this letter) has not been remarkable for
loyalty&mdash;the principal fears of the garrison arose from an
apprehension of treachery. There were then under arms sixty of the
Northumberland Fencibles, about thirty of the Fertullagh Cavalry,
and thirty loyal Protestants, who either belonged to the town or had
fled there for refuge.</p>

<p>On the first appearance of the Rebels, (three hours before the
attack commenced) an express was sent to Tullamore where the
principal part of the 7th Dragoons lay&mdash;General Dunne forwarded a
Troop about eighty in number&mdash;the want of a sufficient force was of
the worst consequence, as the Rebels attacked our party in the
mountains, and obliged the Fencibles to retreat back to the
town&mdash;Meantime the Loyalists cleared the streets which were now
full of

<!-- Page 63 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Rebels without the loss of a man&mdash;the Cavalry
pursued&mdash;Sergeant Price alone killed fourteen Pikemen. On hearing
the firing a few of the Cavalry stationed at Tyrell's-pass flew to
the scene of action, just before the Black Horse arrived&mdash;both,
aided by the dismounted from Tyrrell's-pass killed 400 of the enemy.</p>

<p>This morning, about half past 2 o'Clock, a Dragoon, from an
Out-post, came in and informed

<!-- Page 64 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Major Wardle, of the Ancient
British, that a very considerable armed body were approaching
rapidly upon the Town. The whole garrison were instantly under Arms,
and took up their position according to a plan previously formed in
case of such an event happening. They made the attack upon our
Troops, posted near the Gaol, with great violence, but were
repulsed: They then made a general attack in almost every direction,
as they had got possession of almost every avenue into the Town.
They continued to engage the Troops for near three quarters of an
hour, when they gave way, and fled on all sides. The Cavalry
immediately took advantage of their confusion, charged in almost
every direction, and killed a great number of them. A great quantity
of Arms and Pikes were taken, and within this half hour many hundred
more were brought in, found in pits near the town, together with
three men with green cockades, all of whom were hanged in the public
street. We took another prisoner whom we have spared, in consequence
of his having given us

<!-- Page 65 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
information that will enable us to pursue
these Rebels; and from this man we learn that they were above a
Thousand strong: They were commanded as this man informs us, by
Michael Reynolds, who was well mounted, and dressed in Yeoman
Uniform, but unfortunately made his escape; his horse we have got.</p>

<p>About thirty Rebels were killed in the streets; in the fields, we
imagine, above an hundred; their bodies have not yet been brought
together.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say too much of the Cavalry and Infantry; their
conduct was exemplary throughout.</p>

<p><a name="KILCULLEN" id="KILCULLEN"></a><i>Extract of a Letter from Lieutenant General
Dundas to Lord Viscount Castlereagh, dated Naas, May 25th, 1798.</i></p>

<p>In addition to the account which I had the honor of sending you
yesterday, I have the satisfaction to inform your Lordship, that
about 2&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. yesterday I marched out again to attack the Rebels,
who had assembled in great force on the

<!-- Page 66 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
North side of the Liffey,
and were advancing towards Kilcullen-Bridge: They occupied the hills
on the left of the road leading to Dublin; the road itself and the
fields highly enclosed, on the right. The attack began between 3&nbsp;and&nbsp;4;
was made with great gallantry, the Infantry forcing the Enemy on
the road, and driving them from the hills on the left; the Cavalry
with equal success, cutting off their retreat. The affair ended soon
after&nbsp;4. The slaughter was considerable for such an action; one
Hundred and thirty lay dead. No prisoners.</p>

<p>I have the further satisfaction of stating to your Lordship, that
his Majesty's Troops did not suffer in either killed or wounded. The
Rebels left great quantities of all kinds of Arms behind them, and
fled in all directions.</p>

<p>This morning all is in perfect quietness. General Wilford, from
Kildare, joined me last night; an Officer with whom I serve with
unspeakable satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Troops of every description, both officers and men, shewed a
degree of gallantry which it

<!-- Page 67 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
was difficult to restrain within
prudent bounds.&mdash;Captain La&nbsp;Touche's Corps of Yeomenry distinguished
themselves in a high stile.</p>

<p><a name="HACKETSTOWN" id="HACKETSTOWN"></a><i>Extract of a Letter from the Reverend James Mc&nbsp;Ghee, Vicar of
Clonmore, County Carlow, dated Hacketstown, three o'Clock,&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. May
25,&nbsp;1798.</i></p>

<p>IN consequence of an information received this morning, that a large
body of Rebels were marching to attack the Town, Lieutenant
Gardiner, with the men under his command, and a party of Yeomenry
commanded by Captain Hardy, went out to meet them. Having
reconnoitred their force, which amounted to between three and four
Thousand, they took post on a hill under the Church, and when the
Rebels came tolerably near, the Officers and Men made a Feint, and
retreated into the Barrack.</p>

<p>The Rebels seeing this, came on with a great shout, imagining the
day to be their own. In a few minutes Captain Hume came up with
about thirty of his Troop, and instantly charged them, on

<!-- Page 68 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
which the Rebels retreated. A general Pursuit took place; and so complete
was the rout that above Three Hundred of the miscreants now lie dead on
the field of battle.</p>

<p>To say that the <i>Antrim</i> Regiment behaved well is not any thing new;
but the Yeomen under Captain Hardy's command behaved astonishingly;
nor can I sufficiently commend the conduct of Captain Hume and his
Corps; for though his right arm was in a sling, owing to a very
severe fall from his horse, which prevented his using his sword, he
headed his men with gallantry, and went on with spirit and bravery
that surprized every one, considering his situation.</p>

<p>As to Lieutenant Gardiner, his conduct and steadiness throughout the
whole affair is far beyond my praise; but I am sorry to inform you
that a severe blow of a stone he received on his breast from a
villain whose life he had just saved, prevents his writing to you
himself. He is, however, thank God, walking about, and having been
let blood, is much better; the villain was shot dead on the spot.</p>

<div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>

<p>Every one of the <i>Antrims</i> was vying with each other who should do
his duty best; and I have very great pleasure in telling you that
not a man (Mr.&nbsp;Gardiner excepted, and one Soldier, who received a
contusion in his arm) was in the least injured.&mdash;In short, the
loyalty and zeal of the whole party was beyond any thing that has
been seen on a similar occasion.</p>

<p>Some account of the Battle of Arklow, by H.&nbsp;G. of the Armagh
Militia, in a letter to a Friend in Dublin, dated Arklow, June 13th,&nbsp;1798.</p>

<p>Written on the Field of Action.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>My Dr. Friend,</i></p>

<p>I wrote to Mr.&nbsp;H. by one of the Conductors who promised to leave the
letter at your house, in which I gave him a circumstantial
account<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> of what took place from the time I left Naas, till the
battle of Gorey, and our retreat to Wicklow afterwards.</p>

enquiry made to recover the Letter alluded to, but for the present
it cannot be procured.</i></p></div>

<p>On Saturday last we were informed that the Rebels in great force
were pursuing us, the drums beat to arms, and our forces assembled
immediately. Our General formed a square of Infantry at one end of
the town, and left the Cavalry to defend the other. In a little
time the

<!-- Page 71 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Out-posts were driven in, and shortly after appeared their
Colours flying. They extended for more than <i>five miles</i> around us:
a most awful sight! In order to intimidate us they fixed their hats
on their Pikes and rushed on.</p>

<p>Their Artillery was planted on an eminence which commanded us&mdash;Their
armed men in Front, and pike to charge in the Rear. In this order of
Battle they came forward. We waited the first onset; in a few
minutes the firing commenced in all quarters, which lasted from four
o'clock in the afternoon, till near nine at night. They endeavoured
to break our square in every quarter, but like true Soldiers we
cleaved together and repelled them; they stormed our little line
twice, but were beat back with slaughter; they drove their
dismounted horses to the mouths of the Cannon in order to shelter
themselves, but the grape shot made them fall on every side; they
even set the town on fire in order to annoy us with the smoak, but
the wind at the order of <i>our God</i> turned, drove it from us, and
confounded them in their own device; they did

<!-- Page 72 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
every thing like
inveterate enemies, and desperate madmen to accomplish their ends;
and their Priests informed them that they could catch the Heretics
balls in their hands, and threw some (as tho' they had caught them)
to their rebellious mob to fire again at us, and declared they could
beat us with the dust of the earth. Oh what superstition! This was
confirmed by deserters from their Camp, who informed us likewise,
that flushed with victory at Gorey, they thought that after they had
taken Arklow, nothing could stop them till they arrived at Dublin;
and indeed I believe, that this Battle for the present, has decided
the fate of this Kingdom.</p>

<p>One of the Antrim Militia, who fled from them after the Battle
reports their Army to have been 20,000 strong. Among the slain was
Father Murphy from the County of Wexford. They lost about 1000
killed and wounded, and numbers were hanged in the streets. Every
Regiment vied with each other for victory; we took several stand of
Colours from them, made of green, white and yellow stuff. We have
prepared

<!-- Page 73 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
every thing in case of another attempt&mdash;If they do not
come forward, we will go immediately and retake Gorey, and storm
their Camp. They are greatly discouraged. Blessed be God,
notwithstanding I was exposed to a heavy fire I never received one
wound. On our side we had about 18 killed and 28 wounded. We are all
in high spirits. Capt.&nbsp;Knox of the Yeomenry and two of his men were
killed pursuing Rebels. Our men (in a former engagement) kept the
town of Gorey when the rest of the army left them. They are worth
gold. Pardon this scroll, as I am in haste. We have been under arms
these four days and nights.</p>

destroyed by the Rebels; even the Church did not escape their

<!-- Page 75 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
called Houlett, within seven miles of
Wexford, with an intention of remaining there for the night; but
perceiving their pickets on an adjacent hill that commanded our
Camp, at ten o'clock we struck our Tents, marched by a circuitous
route, and in the morning at dawn of day we found ourselves on the
off-side of their daring position.</p>

<p>From their great numbers and strong bulwarks they concluded they
were impregnable. It is agreed they had that day on Vinegar-hill
30,000! We reconnoitred for some time, and distinctly observed them
to draw up in <i>solid lines</i>. The order of Battle was to commence, by
the command of Gen.&nbsp;Lake, at 9&nbsp;o'clock. His Army took one side of
the Hill to bombard it, the Light Brigade, under Col.&nbsp;Campbell took
another&mdash;other Commanders were fixed in like manner. Our Brigade,
consisting of the Armagh, Cavan, Durham, Antrim, and part of the
Londonderry, Dunbarton, Tyrone and Suffolk&mdash;in all about 3000 brave
Troops had to march four miles; it being appointed that we should
flank them in another quarter.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
</div>

<p>I shall give you a view of their situation&mdash;Vinegar-hill is very
steep, rising in the form of a cone: at the but of it are two other
hills, with quicksets and other ditches across them&mdash;these were
lined with their musketry men:&mdash;a river ran at the bottom of both,
and adjacent was a small wood. At the bottom of Vinegar-hill was the
once beautiful, but now ruined town of Enniscorthy&mdash;on the top of
the great hill was the but of an old windmill, on which they had
placed their <i>green flag</i> of defiance&mdash;in a word, the position of
the Rebels was one of the strongest I ever saw. The Rebels did not
wait the time appointed, but commenced cannonading at seven o'clock.
They could not tell what to make of the bombs, and said "they spit
fire at us"&mdash;indeed they answered they desired end, by the numbers
they destroyed upon their bursting.</p>

<p>The Light Brigade, assisted by the Cavalry gained one of the lesser
hills, planted their Cannon and played briskly on them: in a short
time we possessed ourselves of both&mdash;the Rebels made to the top of
Vinegar-hill with all possible speed&mdash;the

<!-- Page 77 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Soldiers pursued hard
after them, and beat them off it. In a little time the <i>green flag</i>
became a prey to the Royal Band, who triumphed in its fall&mdash;it was
an arduous attempt, but we succeeded in the end. The Rebel
commanders deserted their men when they found the day proved
unfavourable to their interests and fled towards Wexford, leaving
the deluded wretches to be cut in pieces. The engagement lasted two
hours and an half&mdash;the Soldiers merited the cloth they wore, and
gloried in the name of WILLIAM. Our Brigade remained all night in
the demesne of Harvey Hay, one of the Rebel Chiefs: next day we
returned to Houlet again, where we encamped for two days. The
scouting parties killed more after the different engagements than
what fell in Battle&mdash;many of their Commanders, were taken and
hanged. We have suffered much from lying on the roads and ditches
rolled in our blankets, I have almost lost my hearing, but am
content when the good old cause triumphs.</p>

<p>P. S. At Vinegar-hill we killed men of 70 Years old&mdash;we rescued
three Officers of the Antrim

<!-- Page 78 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Militia, and twelve Privates of the
same regiment: yesterday we hanged two of them for endeavouring to
vote away the lives of two of the above Officers and Soldiers when
prisoners.</p>

<p class="salut"><i>Sir,</i></p>

<p><a name="DETAIL_EFFECTS"></a>Altho' I have not the happiness of being personally acquainted with
you, at the request of your Friend, Mr.&nbsp;W&mdash;s, it affords me pleasure
to have it in my power to send you a copy of an <i>acurate detail</i> of
the effects of the late dreadful Rebellion,

<!-- Page 79 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
as it respected this
part of the Kingdom, written by an intimate and fellow sufferer with
me and transmitted to Dublin, for publication in July 1798.</p>

<p>On Friday evening the 25th of May, about 9&nbsp;o'clock, the North Cork
Militia then quartered here, with the Wexford Yeomen Cavalry and
Infantry were ordered under arms, in consequence of an alarm that
the Insurgents were rising in the neighbourhood of Camolin, in this
County; and we continued under arms the whole of that night. On
Saturday orders arrived here from Dublin-Castle to the High Sheriff,
to apprehend B.&nbsp;B. Harvey, J.&nbsp;Colclough of Ballyteigue, and Edward
Fitzgerald of New-park; and they were committed to goal on Saturday
evening and Sunday morning. Early on Sunday morning the 27th of May,
an express arrived here that the day before an engagement took place
between a party of the Camolin Cavalry, commanded by Lieutenant
Buckey, and a large body of the Rebels, that the Lieutenant was
killed, but that they had repulsed the Rebels; that they

<!-- Page 80 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
were then (Sunday morning) in great force in the neighbourhood of Oulard,
burning the houses of different Protestant Inhabitants in that part
of the County. In consequence of this information;
Lieutenant-Colonel Foot with Major Lombard, and six other officers,
and 106 men of the North Cork Militia, immediately proceeded from
this town, and came up with the Rebels at an advantageous position
they had taken on a hill near Oulard. Through the rashness of the
Major, in charging the Rebels in an incautious manner, the whole
party were surrounded, and not a man escaped instant destruction but
the Lieutenant-Colonel and two privates. By this defeat the Rebels
had acquired a powerful accession of strength and confidence, having
got the whole of the arms and about 57 rounds of ball-cartridge from
each man, they not having fired above three or four rounds when they
attempted to charge them with Bayonets. On the following morning,
the 28th, the Rebels attacked Enniscorthy, and after a severe
conflict of three hours, and above 500 of them being slain,

<!-- Page 81 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
they took the town owing to the treachery of some of the inhabitants in
setting fire to the town during the engagement, which obliged the
Militia and Yeomenry to evacuate it, and they, with all the Loyal
inhabitants that could escape, retired on Monday evening to Wexford.
On Tuesday the 29th, the Rebels formed two powerful Camps, one at
Vinegar-Hill, near Enniscorthy, and the other about three miles from
Wexford, at the Three Rocks, on the road between Wexford and Ross,
and sent threats in here that 10000 men would be detached from those
Camps to attack the town next morning.&mdash;On Wednesday the 30th,
information was received that a body of the military, (supposed to
be the 13th regiment) was attacked by the Rebels near their Camp at
the Three Rocks; this induced Lieut.&nbsp;Col.&nbsp;Maxwell, who arrived the
day before with two hundred of the Donegal Militia, to march out
with his men and four troops of Yeomen Cavalry to their assistance;
but before he had come up with them, they entirely cut off the
party, which proved to be a slight detachment of

<!-- Page 82 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the Meath Militia, of about 100 men who were coming to Wexford with three
howitzers; and with these howitzers the Rebels attacked Col.&nbsp;Maxwell's party,
and obliged him to retreat into Wexford. The 13th regiment, who were
coming to our relief, finding they could not proceed to us without
attacking the Rebel Camp, returned back to Waterford. From these rapid
successes, and their encreasing numbers, (as it was supposed there
were then 20000 men ready to attack Wexford) the people here were
panic-struck; and finding that many who were entrusted with arms had
deserted the barriers, and it being considered that others could not
be depended on, the Officers concluded that the town was not
tenable, and without firing a shot it was evacuated on the 30th of
May, and shortly after entered by the Rebels; who kept possession of
it until the 21st of June. As to the different engagements the army
has had with the Rebels at Ross, Newtownbarry, Arklow,&nbsp;&amp;c. you must
already be informed of them; in many instances the reports were
vague and contradictory, I shall therefore

<!-- Page 83 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
confine myself to such
particulars as fell within my own knowledge, of that I have reason
to believe are facts.</p>

<p><a name="ATROCITIES"></a>The atrocities committed by those ferocious tygers
while they held this town, were I believe unprecedented. After taking
possession of the town, without opposition, they immediately shot several
Protestant Inhabitants, tore open most of our houses, destroyed and
carried off our effects, (their rage was most particularly directed
again at poor Mr.&nbsp;Daniels and mine) put every Protestant inhabitant
whom they spared from immediate death (some few excepted that they
received amongst them) to prison; but they would not stop here, we
were obliged to slaughter each other. The Sunday after they had
taken the town, June the third, Pigott, Robson, a Mr.&nbsp;Edwards and I,
were dragged from our cells, and forced by the Rebels to put to
death a man for being an approver against a Priest of the name of
Dixon, who had attempted to swear him to be an United Irishman;
after being made the instrument of his destruction, we were forced for

<!-- Page 84 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
to drag his body from the place of execution and throw it into
the river. After deliberating for some time whether they should
dispatch us at that moment or not, they carried us back to goal.
Others of the prisoners were obliged to perform the like Office to
another approver. After every species of insult and tyranny to us in
prison, the fatal day at length arrived (Wednesday the 20th of
June,) when the total extermination of the prisoners (namely 500)
and all the Protestant inhabitants of the town, man, woman and
child, was openly avowed to be their fixed purpose! About 95 of the
prisoners were taken out and tortured to death by pikes on the
bridge of Wexford; they returned for more victims, and I was dragged
out of the cell, when above fifty wretches (whose ill-will I had
incurred by exerting myself in the line of my duty,) cried out to
have me destroyed. Providentially an express arrived at that moment,
that the army had defeated a considerable party of the Rebels at
Long Graige, between this and Ross, and requiring an immediate
reinforcement; this

<!-- Page 85 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
made them beat to arms, and induced them at
that time to stop the work of blood. The following day they were
totally defeated at their great camp (as they termed it) at
Vinegar-Hill, and routed in all directions, and on the same day the
remaining prisoners were liberated by the army. The horrid cruelties
they committed in this town fell short (if possible) of what they
did in other parts of the County; at Scullabogue, between Taghmon
and Ross, they put 150 Protestants into a barn and burnt them to
death, amongst whom were two beautiful and accomplished young ladies
of the neighbourhood; poor G&mdash;d, the Surveyor of Taghmon, attempted
to escape from the flames at this place and was shot by them&mdash;at
Enniscorthy they scarcely left a Loyal man alive that they could
find, and the town was almost consumed by fire&mdash;There were about ten
of their leaders hanged here, upon the arrival of the army, amongst
whom were B.&nbsp;B. Harvey, Cor.&nbsp;Grogan of Johnstown, Captain Keugh,
J.&nbsp;H. Colclough of Ballyteigue, and Kelly of Killarn, who were
afterwards beheaded, and

<!-- Page 86 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
their heads placed over the Court-house.
In consequence of a proclamation from General Lake, inviting the
Rebels to desert their leaders, and promising pardon, numbers came
in with pikes,&nbsp;&amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Such my dear Sir, is the recital of what I can recollect of the
barbarities practised here during the reign of these monsters. What
my feelings and sufferings were during that period, I cannot attempt
to describe. That the Almighty providence may preserve us all from
such another visitation, is the ardent prayer of, Yours,&nbsp;&amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

the City of Dublin, will furnish the Reader with every particular
relative thereto. The Examinant is well known to the Publisher, and
favoured him with a Copy of the same for the present <i>Narrative</i>.
The Examinant suffered much in the Rebellion, being obliged to

<p>The Examination of J.&nbsp;D. late of Prosperus, in the County of
Kildare, who being duly sworn on the Holy Evangelists, maketh Oath,
and saith; That for many nights previous to the night of the 23d of
May last, this Examinant and his family were very much alarmed lest
they should be attacked by the Rebels commonly called United
Irishmen; That

<!-- Page 88 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Examinant thought he and his family were in some
degree secure, by the arrival of detachments of the Ancient Britons
and the North Cork Militia; That however Examinant still continued
to be alarmed, as his house was a considerable distance from the
Barracks; That Examinant saith that he was awakened about the hour
of one o'clock in the forenoon, by the barking of a large dog he
had, and some time after he was alarmed by the firing of some shots;
Examinant saith that on looking out of his window, he perceived a
great body of people armed with Pikes and Fire Arms, between whom
and the Soldiers in the Barracks a constant firing was maintained;
That as the balls passed by this Examinant's house, and one of them
close to his head, he withdrew and let down the window; That soon
after Examinant saw the Barracks on fire and heard the Soldiers
exclaim, "The house is on fire; we shall be burnt up or suffocated,
we can fight no longer"; That soon after Examinant saw the roof of
said Barracks fall in; Examinant saith that the said Rebels (whose
numbers

<!-- Page 89 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
had encreased so much as to fill the streets of Prosperous
and to cover the adjacent fields) on the falling of the roof of said
Barracks, gave many shouts which seemed to rend the skies, and made
this Examinant and his family thrill with horror; That the said
Rebels exclaimed "That the day was their own, and they would there
plant the Tree of Liberty". Examinant saith that the said Rebels
knocked at his door and desired to have it opened, expecting to find
there a party of Soldiers who had been billited there a short time
before, and Mr.&nbsp;Stamer, who had lodged therein when he went there to
receive his rents, as part of the town of Prosperous belonged to the
said Stamer; Examinant saith that the said Rebels approached his
house in a large body, six of which preceded the rest mounted on
some of the horses which they had taken that morning from the
Ancient Britons at Prosperous; That Examinant as soon as he came out
of his door was surrounded by a party of the said Rebels, who
presented their Pikes at him, and who he expected from the ferocity
of their looks would

<!-- Page 90 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
have instantly put him to death; that one of
the said Rebels held a musket at Examinant's breast with his finger
on the trigger; that another of the said Rebels who was a
turf-cutter, held a drawn sword over Examinant's head, and Examinant
verily believes they would have instantly put him to death, but a
young man in the croud who seemed to have some influence interposed,
beat down the musket which was presented at his breast and said he
should not kill him; Examinant saith that he knew many of the said
Rebels to whom he and his family had been very kind. That soon after
the said Rebels went in quest of the said Stamer, who lodged at some
distance from the said town; that having seized him the said Stamer,
they led him through the street by Examinant's house, surrounded by
a number of Pike-men, while a low fellow held a pistol at his head;
Examinant saith that as he passed by the Examinant's house, he the
said Stamer cast a melancholy farewel look at Examinant and his
family, that soon after the said Rebels massacred the said Stamer;
Examinant saith that soon after he

<!-- Page 91 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
went out with an intention of
enquiring for his friend Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;an inhabitant of Prosperous, and
that before Examinant had gone far he was again surrounded by the
said Rebels, who he verily believes would have put him to death, but
for the interference of the person who had saved him before;
Examinant saith, he discovered soon after that Mr.&nbsp;Brewer, a
respectable manufacturer of said town, who had employed many of the
said Rebels, had been massacred by them, and that his body had been
mangled with savage barbarity; Examinant saith that they also
massacred a poor old man of the age of 70 years and upwards, who
served as Serjeant in his Majesty's forces, they having considered
him as an Orange-man; Examinant is convinced in his mind the only
reason why the said Rebels murdered the said Serjeant was his being
a protestant; Examinant saith that when the said Rebels had
committed the said barbarities, they exclaimed with savage joy
"where are the Heretics now? shew us the face of an Orange-man";
Examinant saith that many women, who acting with the said Rebels, used

<!-- Page 92 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
expressions of that nature, as often and as loud as the men,
and that some old women who were amongst them seemed to brighten on
the occasion, and to shew as much fervent joy as the youngest
amongst them; That some of the said women kissed and congratulated
their fathers, their husbands, or their brothers, on the victory
they had gained, and exclaimed "Dublin and Naas have been taken and
are in possession of our friends; down with the Heretics, and down
with the Orange-men." Examinant saith that many of the wretches who
had been actors in that bloody scene, had come into the town of
Prosperous the preceding day, and in presence of Capt.&nbsp;Swayne, of
the&mdash;Cork Militia, whom with a party of his Regiment that morning,
viz. the 24th of May, they had massacred, and also in the presence
of their Parish Priest of the name of Higgins, and declared their
contrition for their past errors, and gave the strongest assurance
of their loyalty, for the future&mdash;that many of the said Rebels
surrendered their Pikes to the said Swayne, and as such surrender
was considered as a test of their repentance,

<!-- Page 93 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
and as necessary to
entitle them to written protections, numbers of them lamented that
they could not obtain such protections, as they never saw nor had a
Pike, and that many of them declared they would sell their Cow to
purchase a Pike if they knew where it could be bought; Examinant
saith that notwithstanding these declarations many of the said
Rebels appeared in the ranks well armed with Pikes; Examinant saith
he is convinced in his mind that the said Rebels would have
plundered and burnt all the other loyal houses of Prosperous, and
would have murdered the remaining Protestant inhabitants thereof,
but that a party of the Ancient Britons and the Cork Militia, being
a part of the detachment they had murdered that morning,
unexpectedly approached the town, and that the said Rebels on their
appearance, fled towards the bogs and morasses; Examinant saith he
could not refrain from shedding tears at seeing such scenes of
savage barbarity, and that a servant who continued faithful to him
desired him not to shew any sign of concern, lest he might draw on
him the anger and vengeance of the Rebels.</p>
